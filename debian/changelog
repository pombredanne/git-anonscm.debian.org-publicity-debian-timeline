  * iter_paragraphs needs to take an iterable of strings. This fixes an issue
    where we weren't actually including any event data in the Debian package.
    However, I think the cited bug may be about encodings or excessive
    cross-domain security for file:// protocols.
 
    If this is the case, we can do nothing in this package, except point out
    that this is not really supported in all browsers - please configure a
    "real" web server or use:
 
      $ cd /usr/share/debian-timeline && python -m SimpleHTTPServer
 
    And then visit http://localhost:8000/. (Closes: #588062)
